# KSTTest
For the logic,
I read all the names from the selected txt file, put them into an array and divide them into 3 parts (Last Name, Given Name and Rest Of Name)
Because we are going to sort the by Last Name, and then Given name.
then we go through the loop of all the names and sort them by Last Name & Given Name, after that we write the sorted names into text file and rich text box.
